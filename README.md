# Central vendor neutral repository for FHIR profiles to be used in Denmark
This repo hosts a set of profiles that are intended to be reviewed and refactored by the DK FHIR SIG. Depending on the feedback recieved in form of PR's and issues, this repo is to be the primary place to store profiles. If requested, a sync link to simplifier will be added in a near future.
